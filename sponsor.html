      <h3 class = "text-center">We are The NJIT Solar Car Team at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). Our team is participating in the <em>American Solar Challenge</em> competition of 2018, and we look forward to working with you in the future.</h3><br>
      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>The Solar Car Team at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) will build the university’s first-ever, full-size, solar-powered electric vehicle. This multidisciplinary project provides a real-world, systems-engineering experience for students of all majors across all departments at NJIT. In July 2018, the Solar Car Team will compete in the 2,000-mile “American Solar Challenge,” a competition to design, build, and drive solar-powered cars in a cross-country time/distance rally event.</p>
      <p>The competition we are entering is the "American Solar Challenge". It is a competition hosted this year in Nebraska, where universities throughout the world come to compete with their own-built solar car. This competition is a great way to initiate further research in the clean renewable - solar- energy field. Our goal as an organization is to not only build our own solar car at NJIT and join the other universities who are competing, but to also contribute to the development of future technology. For this is our first year competing, we are in need of many different resources to be able to build our solar car.</p>
