      <p class = "text-center">"The NJIT Solar Car Team is an entirely student-run organization whose goal is to complete the research, design, and construction of NJIT’s first ever full-size, solar-powered electric vehicle. Formed in the spring of 2017, the team offers an interdisciplinary, project-based learning community which seeks to provide students with real-world experience in systems engineering.<br><br> Open to all undergraduate and graduate majors in all departments, the Solar Car Team emphasizes sustainable energy, taking initiative, future career preparation, and the development of technical and soft skills in engineering, design, and business.The team offers work in Research and Development (R&D), allowing students to further explore different technical aspects of the solar-powered electric vehicle. Seniors may also use this research for Senior Capstone Design.<br><br> The NJIT Solar Car Team will compete with other collegiate teams and their electric vehicles in the summer of 2018 in the 2,000-mile American Solar Challenge.The NJIT Solar Car Team is open to students across all disciplines at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, from all departments including:</p>

            Ivan, together with Jefferson, initiated the solar car project and founded the NJIT Solar Car Team in March, 2017. Ivan has four years experience in project estimating and management in the general construction of various governmental and commercial projects. Ivan is also involved in device characterization research in the ECE department, where he has published multiple papers, and he does research in the mathematics department, where he is developing faster numerical methods for solving non-linear PDEs for the use in engineering.
